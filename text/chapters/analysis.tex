One of the disadvantages of VPP is that it does not support on-the-fly hardware configuration changes and typically requires a full restart; a simple reload is not sufficient. 
In contrast, the Linux networking stack can handle such changes at runtime, allowing CPUs to be enabled, disabled, or reassigned without interrupting network services.
