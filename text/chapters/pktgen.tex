Although numerous traffic generation tools exist \cite{traffic-generators}, 
this section focuses on a subset commonly used for high-performance benchmarking and synthetic traffic generation in research and practice, namely iPerf3, D-ITG, TRex, Pktgen-DPDK \& Genesids. 

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{iPerf3} -- iPerf3 is a network testing tool used to measure TCP, UDP, and SCTP throughput between two endpoints. It allows detailed configuration of testing parameters such as buffer size, number of parallel streams, test duration, and jitter. iPerf3 can also measure jitter, providing insights into the variation in packet arrival times, which is useful for evaluating network stability. Its client-server architecture makes it a common tool for performance benchmarking of networks and devices.\cite{iperf}

  \item \textbf{TRex} -- TRex, developed by Cisco, is a high-performance, stateful and stateless traffic generator built on top of DPDK. It supports the generation of realistic Layer 4â€“7 traffic using pre-recorded PCAP files and emulates multiple concurrent users and flows. TRex is especially suited for benchmarking network function virtualization (NFV) platforms, routers, and firewalls in both laboratory and production-like environments.\cite{trex} 

\item \textbf{Pktgen-DPDK} -- Pktgen-DPDK is a high-performance traffic generator tool developed as part of the Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK). Pktgen-DPDK supports various network protocols, including IPv4, IPv6, UDP, and TCP. The tool allows precise control over traffic parameters, such as packet rate, size, and timing. Pktgen-DPDK is used in network performance tests and can capture packet-level statistics to assess the performance of the devices under test.\cite{pktgen_dpdk}
