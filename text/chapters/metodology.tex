The RFC 2544 recommends to test be at least 60 seconds in duration\cite{rfc2544} and NAJÍT ZDROJ??? kolikrát opakovat
Each test scenario executed using TRex was repeated 30 times, with each individual run lasting five minutes. 
The reported results represent the arithmetic mean of these 30 measurements. 
In cases where an anomalous spike or irregularity was observed in the results, the corresponding measurement was discarded and the test was repeated.  
All this steps shoudl ensure consistency and statistical reliability.

Transmitted packets and bytes refer exclusively to those that were successfully sent and received without any loss (i.e., without packet drops).

To evaluate energy efficiency, the number of packets per watt (PPW) and bytes per watt (BPW) was used, with all values rounded to two decimal places. 
These metrics provide a measure of how efficiently energy is utilized for each transmitted packet and byte. 
The machine -- when idle -- consumes 144~Watts per minute.
